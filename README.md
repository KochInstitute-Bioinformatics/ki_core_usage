# KI Core Facility Usage - Data cleaning and presentation

Code in this repository assembles and cleans KI Core usage data from ilabs and external sources (if applicable).
The usage data is annotated with Sponsor relationships and plots are prepared.

## Purpose

The visualizations prepared here for the CCSG competivtive renewal application but the strategries can be generalized for other reporting needs.
Each component of the work is a separate Rmd file
Rmd files are run in containerized Rstudio using the singularity_Rstudio_r451.sh script

## Required supporting files

NOTE: MIT certificates are required to access these files.
